# [PBSpotify](https://pbspotify-v3.vercel.app/ "PBSpotify")

PBSpotify creates Spotify playlists based on the track lists of shows broadcast on PBS 106.7FM, a community radio station in Melbourne, Australia.

To achieve this the app interacts with two different external APIs. [The first](https://airnet.org.au/rest/stations/3pbs/programs "Airnet Rest API") is a publically available Rest API which provides JSON data about PBSFM including information about particular PBSFM shows, and track lists for each episode of a show which are provided weekly by the PBS FM Show Host. The second API is the Spotify Web API through which Spotify provides functionality for one of their users to authorise a third party app like this one to create and make changes to one of their playlists via thier [OAuth 2.0 service.](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-flow "Spotify Authorization Code Flow")

The app is currently hosted online via Vercel at [https://pbspotify-v3.vercel.app/](https://pbspotify-v3.vercel.app/ "PBSpotify")
